Mojolicious::Plugin::Dispatch2Directory - Dispatch to directory Hierarchie

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    plugin Dispatch2Directory => {
        document_root   => 'public_html',
        handler         => 'ep',
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a plugin for dispatching paths to directory hierarchie.

Given document_root path would be assigned to both static and renderer roots
and the dispatcher decides how to handle paths by file extensions.

With this plugin, you can enhance static pages in directory hierarchie
by adding extra extension such as .html.ep and can embed dynamic contents
into them as if PHPers do or SSI fans do.
